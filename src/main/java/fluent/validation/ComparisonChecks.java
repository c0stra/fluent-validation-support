/**
 * Factory of ready to use most frequent conditions. There are typical conditions for following categories:
 *
 * 1. General check builders for simple building of new conditions using predicate and description.
 * 2. General object conditions - e.g. isNull, notNull, equalTo, etc.
 * 3. Generalized logical operators (N-ary oneOf instead of binary or, N-ary allOf instead of binary and)
 * 4. Collection (Iterable) conditions + quantifiers
 * 5. Relational and range conditions for comparables
 * 6. String matching conditions (contains/startWith/endsWith as well as regexp matching)
 * 7. Basic XML conditions (XPath, attribute matching)
 * 8. Floating point comparison using a tolerance
 * 9. Builders for composition or collection of criteria.
