/**
 * Simple condition interface used in for validation of various data.
 *
 * It implements the Java 8 Predicate, providing simple #test(V value) method,  which simply tests, if value meets
 * a condition (pretty the same).
 *
 * But the main purpose of this class is to provide transparency during any complex condition evaluation, similar to
 * Hamcrest Matchers.
 * If you are familiar with Hamcrest matchers, it should be easy to get familiar with Checks too. There are only
 * following differences:
 *
 * 1. Evaluation detail is not limited to mismatch description. You can achieve full detail even for passed ones.
 * 2. This interface is type-safe on application (see test() methods are accepting class type argument, not Object).
 *    It may be limiting, but helps avoid test errors.
 * 3. Thanks to it being generic, it's very simple to simplify creation of any custom, or composed conditions with
 *    advantage of Java 8 functional interfaces (lambdas).
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the data to be tested using this condition.
